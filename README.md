# Verteilte Systeme in Wintersemester 2021/22

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run the projekt is by using `docker-compose`

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Assignment

in the context of this course we are designing a distributed system for "Supply Chain Monitoring".
Below you can find a diagram of the full project we are buidling. The goal is not to build the most
realistic supply chain monitoring but rather to focus on the communication of the distributed system,
the system design, the tests and the deployment of the application.
